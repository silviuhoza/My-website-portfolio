        <p>Silviu Hoza, I'm a web developer, with a strong passion for coding. I'ved learned to code on my one, with self taughting, because I wanted to change my life first, and in the same time to provide good services to other people. Before finding this passion for coding, I graduated from two University, first was The Psychology and the second was focused on The Human and Social Sciences. As you can see I have a inclination to the people and I want to help others with my services. One of my goal is to bring thankfulness to the people that I meet everyday, that's way I'm trying to provide high quality services.  </p>
